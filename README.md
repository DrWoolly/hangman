# hangman
It's a command line hangman, nothing fancy.

There's a couple of additional features added for "hint" and "definition"

if the words.txt file is not installed, then the programme will need an internet connection to get the word list and create the words.txt file.

The definition feature will require an internet connection and for the merriam webster site to be up and running, otherwise the defintion function will return "Online Definition Unavailable".
